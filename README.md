1. Installations<br>
Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, as well as what what version of python you are using should be noted.<br>
<br>
2. Project Motivation<br>
Discuss what your project is about, and what interested you in pursuing the project.<br>
<br>
3. File Descriptions<br>
 Guide others through the files in your repository. You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find the work they might find most interesting.<br>
 <br>
4. How to Interact with your project<br>
When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?<br>
<br>
5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.<br>
You always want to give credit where necessary. Acknowledge other contributors, helpful peers, data providers, etc.<br>
<br>
You can use this to assist as a template for your own post.<br>
